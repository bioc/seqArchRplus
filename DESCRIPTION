Description: seqArchRplus enables downstream analyses of promoter sequences 
    architectures/clusters identified by seqArchR. Included features are:
    ordering clusters by their shape (interquantile widths); plot panels showing
    per cluster shape, TPM and conservation score distributions, sequence 
    logos, and peak annotations; per cluster chromosome and strand 
    distributions, motif occurrence heatmaps; writing cluster BED track files 
    and more. seqArchRplus can also generate HTML reports for easy viewing and 
    comparison of promoter architectures between samples/stages.
