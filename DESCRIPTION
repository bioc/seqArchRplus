Description: seqArchRplus enables downstream analyses of promoter
    sequences architectures/clusters identified by seqArchR. With additional 
    available information such as the TPM values and interquantile widths 
    (IQWs) of the CAGE tag clusters, seqArchRplus can order the sequence 
    clusters from seqArchR by their shape (IQWs), and write the cluster 
    information as browser/IGV track files. Provided visualizations are of two 
    kind: per sample/stage and per cluster visualizations. Those of the
    first kind include: plot panels for each sample showing per cluster shape, 
    TPM and conservation score distributions, sequence logos, and peak 
    annotations. The second include per cluster chromosome and strand 
    distributions, motif occurrence heatmaps and GO term enrichments. 
    Additionally, seqArchRplus can also generate HTML reports for easy viewing 
    and comparison of promoter architectures between samples/stages.
